Hello guys, here is the 2nd part of blog. This is the most critical bug i have ever found in TryHackMe, using this bug an attacker can edit and delete any rooms of THM.  
I uploaded the POC video to Youtube.  
**Shortest Bug Explanation:** Any room is edited through a parameter with a room name, i created two room with two different accounts. While deleting/editing the 1st room name i intercepted the request and change the 1st room to 2nd room name, it throwed 403. In next attempt i added a second parameter(Parameter Pollution) with the 2nd room name, the check bypassed and the other room got delete/edited.  
**POC video:**
